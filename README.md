# Smile Detector
Smile and face detection based on the opencv library.
Try it out:

```
$ pip install opencv-python
$ git clone https://github.com/luckyluke96/Smile_Detector.git
$ cd Smile_Detector
$ python Smile_Detector.py
```

If you have issues installing opencv, try it within an Anaconda environment. That solved it for me!
