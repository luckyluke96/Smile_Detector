# Smile Detector
Smile and face detection based on the opencv library.
Try it out:

```
$ pip install opencv-python
$ git clone https://github.com/luckyluke96/Smile_Detector.git
$ cd Smile_Detector
$ python Smile_Detection.py
```

If you have issues installing opencv, try it within an Anaconda environment.
The Smile_Detector is connected to a C#-Script to be used in the Unity Gameengine.
To execute properly Smile_Detector needs to be executed while the C#-Script is already running. Otherwise the Socket-Connection will fail.
